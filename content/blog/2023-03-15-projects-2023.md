## **CF Practice Tracker**

*(in collaboration with WebOps & Blockchain Club, CFI, IITM)*

### *Project Description*

This project aims to make a website that keeps track of user's submission on CodeForces, where we can upload our own Problem Sets and see how much has each participant solved. There is also a recommendation feature that recommends problems based on all problems attempted by the user. Through this website, participants can be monitored effectively.

### *Project Mentors*

Mantra Trambadia (CS20B083), Yatharth(WebOps Club, BS20B039)

### *Project Members*

Anmol Panda	(CS21B005), Balakumar R	(ME20B043), Mahadevu Sudheer (ME21B102), Nishant Sahoo (ME20B122)

## **Algorithmic Trading Platform**

*(in collaboration with Finance Club, IITM)*

### *Project Description*

Development of trading strategies that can be used on real-life markets. The trading platform acts as an interface between the trading strategy and the market. We can easily simulate & test different strategies and analyse their performance on real market data without having to do any real trade. The platform, together with the trading strategies, is a marketable product.

This project aims to:

- Develop Algorithmic Trading Strategies; add backtesting functionalities for different trading strategies by simulating them on market data. Codebase shifting of existing backtracking functionalities.
- Develop a Virtual Trading Platform that manages requests (current stock price, buy, sell, cancel etc.) from trading strategy algorithms and maintains track of the same.
- Make TCP/IP & API connections with a Trading broker and simulate the trading strategy algorithms on real market data.

## **Visualizer Library**

### *Project Description*

The aim of this project is to create a library for implementing and simulating the games and applications used by us in our daily lives, and implementation of an advanced algorithm.
This project consists of 3 mini projects â€” Splitwise app emulator, Stable matching problem and deterministic solution of snake game.
The project also involves the use of tools for the visualization of the above algorithms.

These algorithms can be used by app developers for working on a similar project and making modifications to it.
This project can impart a visual understanding of the algorithmic procedures involved in the working of the apps/games used in our daily life.

### *Project Mentors*

## **Natural Selection Simulator**

### *Project Description*

This project aims to simulate a natural ecosystem and plot the variations in traits of certain species for various starting environments, initial traits and behavioural aspects specified for each species along with implementing random variations in inheritance of traits over generations to see natural selection in action. This can be employed in educational institutions to teach about the role of natural selection in evolution and how nature prefers certain traits to others.
