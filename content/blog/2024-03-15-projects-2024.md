## **Cache Oblivious Algorithms**

### *Project Description*

Performance isn't always about theoretical complexity. At the end of the day, silicon executes our program. The design of algorithms should consider the aim of using the hardware efficiently.  Smartly using caches is one of the best ways to improve performance. Cache-aware algorithms are fine-tuned with knowledge of cache sizes. Cache oblivious algorithms are built to provide similar performance on any cache size.

We will try out a few cache-oblivious algorithms, followed by implementing a cache-oblivious priority queue. We will test out their performance against normal implementations and find out why they are/are not faster.

## **Algorithmic Trading Platform - Server**

*(In Collaboration with Finance Club, IITM)*

### *Project Description*

An exchange is a marketplace where financial instruments like stocks are traded. The aim of this project is to implement an exchange server using concepts of network programming. Ideally, the server should have a low latency period, receive requests and maintain those in an order book and send confirmations when the orders are fulfilled.
We will parse HTTP requests, maintain user information, process requests for placing/cancelling orders, fulfil feasible orders and update records.

## **Algorithmic Trading Platform - Algorithms**

*(In Collaboration with Finance Club, IITM)*

### *Project Description*

Algorithmic Trading is one of the buzzwords in the world of financial trading. Since its inception, extensive research has been done in this field to develop multiple algorithms. This project aims to implement these algorithms cleanly and efficiently and test out these implementations on historical market data.

Along with this, we will also refer to multiple research papers to learn about randomized processes and the generation of synthetic market data for backtesting purposes. We will also learn about multiple financial indicators and then combine all of this to develop our trading strategies.

## **Astrophysical Stellar Simulator**

*(In Collaboration with Horizon Club, CFI, IITM)*

### *Project Description*

This project aims to tackle the famous N-body problem, which lacks analytical solutions, to gain insights into the behavior of complex systems occurring in the real world. Starting with a simple star-planet system and gradually extending our scope to computing how two galaxies collide, computations can get huge quickly as the number of interactions to be considered grows quadratically with the number of bodies.

Two-body systems have planar solutions, but three or more bodies are complex. Exact mathematical models do not exist, but we aim to solve the general case and progress towards an n-body system. The overall idea of the project is to understand and solve the differential equations that govern the interaction between the objects and at the same time, optimise the code for practical applications.
